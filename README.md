Chernobyl Scene implemented in OpneGL
![alt text](/myProject.png)
This project is implemented in OpenGl and represent a scene from 1986. The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR.
1. The objects were created and rendered in Blender.
2. The user can move through scene with  W,A,S,D. 
3. A day-night effect was implemented, so the scene is getting darker.
4. Shadows were implemented on all objects, so the scene looks pretty realistic.
5. Smoke-animation: I wanted to simulate the day of the accident, so I added the dark smoke animation on the 4th reactor.
6. The user can make the scene even more horror. Taste 5 and fog will be added to the scene.
